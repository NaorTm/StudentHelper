# Data sources policy

## 1) Corpus scope
Only approved, official sources should be used for answering, for example:
• institutional regulations and policies  
• official university pages exported to PDF  
• official FAQs and circulars  
• official forms and procedures  
• relevant national regulations, if included as documents in the corpus

## 2) Versioning rules
• Every source must have a version label and a date.  
• If multiple versions exist, mark at least one as active.  
• Prefer active versions during retrieval by default.  
• Keep inactive versions for audit.

## 3) Trust tiers
Tier 1, primary official sources  
Tier 2, official summaries or FAQs that reference Tier 1  
Tier 3, unofficial content, avoid using in answering mode

## 4) Language handling
• Preserve original language text.  
• If answering in a different language, keep citations in the source language and optionally add a translated excerpt, clearly marked as translation.

## 5) Privacy
Do not ingest documents containing personal data, unless explicitly needed and legally permissible. Prefer redacted versions.

## 6) Disclaimer
The system provides information extracted from uploaded documents. It does not provide legal advice.
